          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">4. Introduction</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            Quolance is a platform that connects clients and freelancers in the tech industry. Clients post projects,
            and freelancers submit proposals. We facilitate connections but do not guarantee project matches or
            outcomes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">5. No Contract or Payment Handling</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            Quolance does not draft contracts or handle payments. Clients set budget ranges for projects, but all
            financial agreements are solely between the client and freelancer. We do not enforce payments or budget
            commitments.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">6. Project Posting Rules</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
            <li>Projects must be contract-based work, not job offers.</li>
            <li>Advertisements disguised as projects are prohibited.</li>
            <li>Projects must not contain harmful, illegal, or unethical requirements.</li>
            <li>Our AI reviews project submissions:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Clearly valid projects are automatically approved.</li>
                <li>Uncertain projects require manual admin approval.</li>
                <li>Clearly violating projects are rejected.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Clients can appeal rejected projects by contacting support@quolance.com.</li>
            <li>Some projects may be publicly visible to users outside Quolance. Users should avoid sharing personal or
              sensitive information in project descriptions. Such details should only be shared after selecting a
              freelancer.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">7. User Responsibilities</h3>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">9. Account Management</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            Users can delete their accounts at any time. Account deletion is permanent and results in the loss of all

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">10. Platform Rules Enforcement</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            We reserve the right to delete projects violating platform rules. We may ban users who repeatedly violate
            rules or endanger the platformâ€™s functionality and community.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">11. Global Accessibility and Compliance</h3>
